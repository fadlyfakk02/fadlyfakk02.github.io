            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Fadly Difak Al Fatah, but at home, they call me Difak. Outside or at school and college, you can call me Fadly. I was born in a hospital in the city of Serang and I'm originally from Kecamatan Carenang, Desa Kidongdong Gebang. My background is a mix; my dad is a native of Serang, my mom is from Karawang, but she has Ambon, Betawi, and Chinese roots. So yeah, I'm quite the blend!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey everyone! My name is Fadly Difak Al Fatah, but at home, they call me Difak. Outside, whether at school or college, you can call me Fadly. I was born in a hospital in the city of Serang, and I come from Kecamatan Carenang, Desa Kidongdong Gebang. My heritage is a mix; my dad is a native of Serang, and my mom hails from Karawang, but she has roots in Ambon, Betawi, and Chinese communities. So, Im quite the blend!
        </p>
        <p>
            I started my educational journey at Paud Tulip Carenang, then moved on to SMPN 1 Binuang for middle school. For high school, I attended SMAN 1 Carenang. Currently, I'm studying at Universitas Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa, in the Faculty of Engineering, majoring in Informatics. Im in my second semester now and am super passionate about Web Development, diving deep into the world of programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my school years, Ive achieved quite a bit. In elementary school, I was ranked third in the first grade, and from the second grade until graduation, I consistently held the second position. During middle school, I focused more on organizations and won first place in the LKBB scouts competition three times, and I was also awarded the best drill commander once. High school was a busy time; in my first year, I ranked second, and from the second year until graduation, I maintained the first position. I graduated as the top student in my high school. Additionally, I was the head of the scouts, known as the pradana putra, and continued to excel in LKBB competitions, bringing home first-place trophies.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a strong ambition to lead, no matter where I am. From elementary school to high school, I was always the class president. When I started college, I was chosen as the leader of the Informatics batch of 2023, and I named our batch VOYAGERS. Im grateful for the support from those around me, especially my parents, who always pray for me to be a wise and neutral leader.
        </p>
        <p>
            My leadership principle is simple: don't be selfish and listen to what others have to say. Even though there are things we shouldnt listen to, we must remain neutral. When your friend is wrong, tell them; don't ignore it just because they are your friend. As a leader, if Im wrong, Ill accept it. But if Im right and blamed, you better be ready to argue with me. No matter how much criticism or dislike I get, I dont care. I'm the one living my life, so why should you control it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Thats a bit about me. Cheers!
        </p>
